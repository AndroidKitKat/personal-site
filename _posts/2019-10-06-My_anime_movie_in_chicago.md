Since I had mentioned that I would be going to Chicago for an anime movie this past weekend, I had figured I'd do a little blog post about it. 

I went to go see [Seishun Buta Yarou wa Yumemiru Shoujo no Yume wo Minai Movie](https://anilist.co/anime/104157/Seishun-Buta-Yarou-wa-Yumemiru-Shoujo-no-Yume-wo-Minai-Movie/), which is Japanese for "Rascal Does Not Dream of Dreaming Girl." The movie follows the anime [Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl-senpai no Yume wo Minai](https://anilist.co/anime/101291/Seishun-Buta-Yarou-wa-Bunny-Girlsenpai-no-Yume-wo-Minai/) (Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai). I know, based on the name, it sounds pretty weird. But, I assure you it's a good show despite the title.

I had a pretty good time in Chicago despite the few mistakes I made in going there. My biggest mistake was forgetting that Chicago is in Central Time, but I had planned everything for Eastern Time. It wasn't a *huge* issue, since I was able to explore Chicago by foot. I got to see a lot of nice art in Millenium Park and just take in the big city vibe, which is something I don't get to do often.

As for the movie, it was excellent and very emotional for a lot of people, myself included. By the end, over half the theater had cried or was emotionally shook. I won't spoil it, but if you do eventually see, it just bring tissues.

I plan on doing something similar again for the [Konosuba movie](https://www.fathomevents.com/events/konosuba) that is coming to the US November 12th. Konosuba is one of my favorite comedies of all time and if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it. If anyone wants to go with me, I would be willing to take  anyone along.
