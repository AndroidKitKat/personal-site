# 私のブログへようこそ！／ Welcome to my blog!

こんいちは！ マイケルです。私はアニメ、コンピューター、J-POPが好きです。

Hi there, my name is Mike Eisemann. I'm 20 years old and a Junior at the University of Notre Dame studying computer science. Some of my interests are anime, computers/video games, and music, specifically J-POP. 

Some of my favorite anime are:

| Lucky Star | Darling in the Franxx | Gabriel Dropout |

I do not have much time for anime or much other as of late, mainly due to my course load increasing. However, when I do have time, I have been watching [Kanata no Astra](https://anilist.co/anime/107663/Kanata-no-Astra/).

Some information about me:

 * I am from the small town of Galesburg, Illinois, which is about 4 hours south of Chicago and sort of in the middle of nowhere. 
 
 * I only got interested in Japan and Japanese during my freshman year of college. Before then, all I had known about Japan was that my grandfather served in the military during the United States' occupation of Japan after World War II. I have since fallen in love with the language and the rich, rich history and culture of Japan. 
 
 * I love computers and love to run my own web services whenever possible. For example, this blog runs entirely using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) running off of a computer I configured myself. I find it very fun to face the challenges some of the DIY projects bring. I've also got a file sharing/link shortening service at [https://waifupaste.moe/](https://waifupaste.moe/). It's pretty fun to make things work with computers. 
 
 * I regularly listen to J-POP/Japanese music. Some of my favorite songs are:
 
 | 君のせい by 'the peggies' | 言いて。 by 'ヨルシカ' | Mousou Express from the MONOGATARI Series |

If you want to discuss anything Japanese pop-culture, feel free to get in contact with me. I would be more than happy to meet new people who are interested in the same things I am. 

## My Expectations and Thoughts on this Class

I really hope to learn a lot during this semester. I've self studied bits and pieces of Japanese over the past couple years, and even purchased books such as Japanese for Busy People and GENKI I, but never had some of the self-discipline to really put my nose to the grind stone. 
I think that formally taking a class will make me  put in the extra effort to achieve more. I'm excited to go through the long and strenuous journey that is learning Japanese with you all.
