# Going to an Upcoming Anime Film! 

Just bought tickets to go see [Seishun Buta Yarō wa Yumemiru Shōjo no Yume o Minai (Rascal Does Not Dream of a Dreaming Girl)](https://rascaldoesnotdream.com/) at AMC River East 21 in Chicago for Thursday, October 3, 2019. 

I really enjoyed the main series anime this show was based off, [Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl-senpai no Yume wo Minai](https://anilist.co/anime/101291/Seishun-Buta-Yarou-wa-Bunny-Girlsenpai-no-Yume-wo-Minai/), and I just have to go see the movie. If anyone else is interested in going with me, I would be happy to drive up to 3 other people to see the movie with me, all you need to do is purchase your ticket. I know the middle of the week isn't the best day to go see a movie nearly 2 hours away, but there are no other closer threaters. I also am aware that a lot of people have exams during this week (because I do), but all mine are earlier in the week. 

If you are at all interested in going, please fill out this Google Form: [https://forms.gle/BtX8TuxYF2bU5wgj7](https://forms.gle/BtX8TuxYF2bU5wgj7). 

Thanks for reading!
