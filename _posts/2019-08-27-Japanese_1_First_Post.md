# 私のブログへようこそ！／ Welcome to my blog!

こんいちは！　私はマイケルです。私はアニメ、コンピューター、J-POPが好きです。

Hi there, my name is Mike Eisemann. I'm a Junior at the University of Notre Dame studying computer science. Some of my interests are anime, computers/video games, and music, specifically J-POP. 

Some of my favorite anime are:

| Lucky Star | Darling in the Franxx | Gabriel Dropout |

I do not have much time for anime or much other as of late, mainly due to my course load increasing. However, when I do have time, I have been watching [Kanata no Astra](https://anilist.co/anime/107663/Kanata-no-Astra/).

Some information about me:

 * I am from the small town of Galesburg, Illinois, which is about 4 hours south of Chicago and sort of in the middle of nowhere. 
 
 * I only got interested in Japan and Japanese during my freshman year of college. Before then, all I had known about Japan was that my grandfather served in the military during the United States' occupation of Japan after World War II. I have since fallen in love with the language and the rich, rich history and culture of Japan. 
 
 * I love computers and love to run my own web services whenever possible. For example, this blog runs entirely using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) running off of a computer I configured myself. I find it very fun to face the challenges some of the DIY projects bring.
 
 * I regularly listen to J-POP/Japanese music. Some of my favorite songs are:
 
 | 君のせい by 'the peggies' | 言いて。 by 'ヨルシカ' | Mousou Express from the MONOGATARI Series |
