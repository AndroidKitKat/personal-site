# My Projects

A tiny application that will sync your git repos if you want them to. 

I had the idea for something similar to this when I first deployed this website. I wanted to be able to keep everything self hosted, but also lightweight. I was told I should investigae using something like Travis CI, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins, but I really wasn't liking those ideas for a couple of reasons

1. Travis CI isn't free

2. GitLab CI/CD or public Jenkins would require SSH access into my box

3. Jenkins is too overkill for what I wanted to do

So, using my knowledge building another website with tornado, I made tugboat. I think it was a good exercise of warming myself back up to real Python developing since leaving school for the summer.
