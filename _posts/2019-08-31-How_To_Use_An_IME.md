## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

I am making this blog post because after reading the instructions on setting up Japanese Input Method Editor (IME) sensei has on the main blog page, I felt like a more up to date instruction set would not hurt. This blog post shows you how to set up Japnaese input on almost all major platforms, but when in dobut, do a little research on your own or feel free to get in contact with me. I would be more than happy to help anyone having difficulties getting things set up. You can shoot me an email using the E-Mail link or dropping a comment on this page. I'll do my best to respond to anyone having difficulties. 

## macOS <a name="macos"></a>

It's fairly simple to set up and use the Japanese IME on macOS. This guide is written while using macOS 10.15, but it should apply to most recent versions. 

Step 1: Open System Preferences to 'Keyboard'

Step 3: Select Japanese from this list, and click add

There you go, you've succesfully added the Japanese IME on macOS. But, how do you use it? It's fairly simple, actually. To switch input methods, hit 'Control' and 'Space at the same time. What this does is switch your input to Hiragana, but typed using Romaji. The instructions sensei handed out in class on 08/30/2019 are good enough to get started using a Mac.

## Windows <a name="windows"></a>

The Japanese IME on Windows 10 is very, very different than the one from macOS. It's a little unintuitive, but I've made it work.

Step 1: Go to the Windows settings by clicking on the gear icon in the Windows menu

Step 2: Select 'Time and Language' and then 'Language'

</p>

Step 2: Click Add Language and Select Japanese

Step 3: You most likely don't want to set Japanese to be your Windows Display Language, so go ahead and keep only 'Install language pack' selected. Then hit 'Install'. From there, Windows will download and install the Japanese Language Pack. This could take a bit of time depending on your connection.

Step 4: You should now see 'ENG' in your task bar. To switch to Japanese, hit Windows + Space at the same time. It should change to an 'A' and a 'J'. This means alphanumeric input, which is essentially the same thing as English input. To switch to kana input push 'Alt' and '~' at the same time.

Step 5: The most confusing part for me is that every application on your computer will have different language settings. This is a big difference between the default one for macOS. For example, if I'm using Microsoft Word in Japanese input, and then switch to Google Chrome, my input method switches back to English.

Again sensei's instructions should be able to help you actually use the IME.

## Linux <a name="linux"></a>

Linux is a very big can of worms. Almost every distribution is different and each application framework will work differently with whatever IME you choose. I personally use [Arch Linux using ibus + anthy](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/IBus#Japanese), but since most people using Linux who would be reading this guide are probably using Ubuntu, I will target Ubuntu 18.04. For this section in particular, please reach out to me for any help, since I personally use Linux every day and can help anyone who is having troubles. I'll update this section as I get things working, so just hang tight. <3

## iOS <a name="ios"></a>

It is fairly simple to get the Japanese IME on iOS. This will be done using an iPhone XS running iOS 13.1, but should apply to all iOS devices regardless of model and version. 

Step 1: Go to Settings, then General, then Keyboards, and then Keyboards. 

Step 2: Hit 'Add New Keyboard...'

Step 3: Select 'Japanese' and then Romaji. Now, click 'Done' in the top right. 

It's that simple. To make Japanese your active keyboard. Go to the textbox you'd like to input text into, and then click the Globe icon on your keyboard. This will switch between English and Japanese.

## Android <a name="android"></a>

I apologize ahead of time if the instructions are out of date for this section. I haven't used an Android phone in some time, but I think for the most part, things here should be still relevant. Worst case, search for your specific device model and typing in Japanese. This section is also currently a WIP.

This guide is done on a Nexus 5, running Android 4.4.

Step 1: Go to the Play Store and search for the 'Google Japanese Input' and install it. 

Step 2: Find the newly installed app on your device and follow the instructions. It will ask you to enable the method for your device, and select it as your input method. Do these.

Step 3: Now, go back to the app and select 'Keyboard Layout' at the top. Then slide the layout over to 'QWERTY'. This will allow you to type with Romaji. 

That's it. There are some things you will want to know. To switch between your English and Japanese layouts, most phones will place a globe in the Notification Shade for you to select which input you want to use.

Have fun with your new input method!
